# AirScrum
My open source Scrum tool - completed for my final year project at Hull University. Very incomplete and requires lots more work!

There is more information available on my website.

The basis for this project is to allow anyone to have access to a Scrum tool. 
The issue with Scrum and other Agile ways of working is that there are many ways of doing them.
This project aims to provide a good basis for anyone to use, and that will allow for future improvements that can improve the system
for their own uses.
